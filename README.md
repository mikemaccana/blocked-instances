List of Toot CafÃ© blocked instances
=======

This is a list of Mastodon/GNU Social instances blocked by [toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe). If you think an instance has been unfairly blocked, please open an issue and/or a pull request.

The purpose of this is to be transparent and to collaborate with other admins on identifying those instances that violate the commonly-accepted Code of Conduct in the Mastodon community based on [the example set by mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about/more), or those that tend to contain bad actors who do, and who boost unwanted content into other instances.

### Footnotes

- \* Silenced vs suspended: silenced means they don't appear in the Federated timeline, but if someone discovers the accounts somehow (e.g. via replying to another toot) then they can follow and it will appear in their Home view.
- \*\* "Free speech zone": a place where it's okay to promote e.g. National Socialism because the argument is that open discussion is more important than people's sensitivities or the denazification laws of Germany/France/etc. The term is not meant in a derogatory way; if there's a better one, let me know.
- \*\*\* lolicon: sexualized depictions of children

Notes on our instance
-----

- We don't accept hate speech.
- We don't accept violent nationalism or National Socialism.
- We are not a "free speech zone."
- We come from a different cultural heritage than many of the GNU Social instances.
- We pass no judgment on those that do, but our users may not want to engage with such content. This is what alt accounts are for. ðŸ˜‰
